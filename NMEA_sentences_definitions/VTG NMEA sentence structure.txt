
The VTG NMEA sentence structure is as follows:

$--VTG,x.x,T,y.y,M,u.u,N,v.v,K,m*hh<CR><LF>

Here's a breakdown of each field:

1) $GPVTG or $GNVTG: 	The message ID
2) x.x:		Track Made Good (True): The track made good in degrees (0–359.9), relative to true north.
3) T:		Fixed text "T" - This indicates that the track made good is relative to true north.
4) y.y:		Magnetic Track - This field represents the track made good in degrees relative to magnetic north.
5) M:		Reference - This indicates that the previous value is relative to magnetic north.
6) u.u: 	This field indicates the speed over ground in knots, which can have 0 to 3 decimal places.
7) N:		Units - Fixed text "N" indicates that speed over ground is in knots
8) v.v:		Speed over ground in kilometers/hour (0–3 decimal places)
9) K:		Units - Fixed text "K" indicates that the speed over ground is in kilometers per hour.
10) m:		Fixed text for Mode "A"=Autonomous, "D"=DGPS Differential, "E"=Estimated (dead reckoning), "N"= not valid
11) *hh:	Checksum data, always begins with *

Field marked as '10)' apply only to NMEA version 2.3 (and later) in this NMEA message description.
