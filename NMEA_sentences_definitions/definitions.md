Here are all the definitions for the different NMEA0183 sentences, explained in detail by data fields

- **GBS** NMEA sentence structure: [link](https://github.com/MicroControleurMonde/RP2040_GPS_NMEA/blob/main/NMEA_sentences_definitions/GBS%20NMEA%20sentence%20structure.txt)

      The GBS sentence is primarily used to ensure the integrity of GNSS signals
  
- **GGA** NMEA sentence structure: [link](https://github.com/MicroControleurMonde/RP2040_GPS_NMEA/blob/main/NMEA_sentences_definitions/GGA%20NMEA%20sentence%20structure.txt)

        The GGA sentence provides fundamental positioning data from a GNSS receiver

- **GLL** â€“ Geographic Position (Lat_Long): [link](https://github.com/MicroControleurMonde/RP2040_GPS_NMEA/blob/main/NMEA_sentences_definitions/GLL%20%E2%80%93%20Geographic%20Position%20(Lat_Long).txt)
  
        The GLL NMEA sentence is used to transmit basic positioning information (latitude, longitude, UTC time)
        and the status of the GNSS fix.
        It's a simple and lightweight.
