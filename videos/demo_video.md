In this folder you can find videos demonstrating the use of:
- GLL NMEA Decoder
- GSV NMEA Decoder
- VTG NMEA Decoder
  
The examples provided show the codes operating in "*normal*" mode (the GPS chip sends continuous NMEA frames after the interpretation of the satellite information) and how the decoding of each sentence is organized.


These videos are provided as examples of how the code functions when used with an IDE such as Thonny.
